Files -> calculate students enrolled -> Randomly -> Ranodm Course Total Capacity + Other Courses Capacity [Tuple] < 280 && > 250 -> Random Solution

Solution -> Table Form

-> Random solution bs exams scheduled for 2-3 weeks


-> Solution for 2-3 weeks X
-> Cost Function X
-> Constraints X
-> Weights X
-> How to check how much soft constraints have been fulfilled X



-> Store Hard and soft constraint in a list
-> Each exam has 3 Hour -> 2 Exams Max per day -> Break allow

-> Hard Constraint -> [Perfect Solution] -> 
-> Soft Constraint -> [Best Solution] ->


-> Return solution
